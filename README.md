# Front-end Job Interview Questions

This file contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

**Note:** Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

#### General Questions:

* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
-I learned some mathematical methods using Python
-I continued learning Angular 2 using Udemy
* What excites or interests you about coding?
-The process of solving problems and creating virtual machinery
* What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
-I learned to use promises with AngularJS to return weather and concert data all at once
* What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?
-Maintainability-Comments, 
-Performance-Sass, asynchronous loading, use of CSS over images
-UI-Usability, accessibility, W3CAG standards, scalability
-Technology-Consideration for multiple browsers, old versions
* Talk about your preferred development environment.
-Depending on framework-I consistently use Windows 10 and cmder, but if I'm using Django I use PyCharm, for everything else VSCode
* Which version control systems are you familiar with?
-Git, Grunt
* Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?
-Start with wireframing, continue with mockups, begin scaffolding with html and JQuery
-If creating a larger, multifaceted site, I use Yeoman with whatever framework is appropriate
* If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?
-Either combine into one or repurpose into SASS
* Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
-Progressive enhancement = site getting more features, more improved with newer browsers
-Graceful degradation = site not compromising experience but accomodating less featured older browsers
* How would you optimize a website's assets/resources?
-Check for caching
-No inline code-separate files
-decrease download sizes, make fewer http requests
-Name the assets, host them on different cookie-free domains, disable etags
* How many resources will a browser download from a given domain at a time?
-Between 4 and 8, mostly 6 though

-Optimize resources, 
* If you jumped on a project and they used tabs and you used spaces, what would you do?
-Adapt.  I did not start the project, I might voice my preference and see where there might be room for compromise but when in Rome, do as Romans do.
* Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page.
-Start with the bootstrap cdn, create indicators, create carousel items, and then create links to control the carousel.
* If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?
-Angular 2 or Django.  Mastery of a framework would free me up to master stuff like data visualization and other tech that I could support with the framework.

-Creating an environment in which collaboration is possible on a large scale-standards means open source has a sense of guidance, means teams that come together have an idea of how to do things
* What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?
-Flash of unstyled content is when HTML loads before CSS and for a frame or two you get nothing but unstyled HTML-put stylesheet links at the top of the HTML document to prevent this
